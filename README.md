# DARE_UI
Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) faces light absorption, scattering, fluorescence, and poor illumination. We propose (i) SDUI-9, an annotated dataset of nine degradations, and (ii) DARE-UI, a recursive framework where a classifier detects dominant degradations and iteratively applies targeted enhancement until restoration.
